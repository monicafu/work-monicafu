			<h4>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h4>
			The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a very intelligent herding breed. As such, Pembrokes typically need a job to do to keep them busy and out of trouble, but are not on the go 24 hours a day like some other herding breeds. They are extremely quick to learn, but unlike some breeds like Golden Retrievers, aren’t necessarily willing to please for praise. Food and toy rewards are great motivators while negative reinforcement will cause a Pembroke to shut down. They excel in agility, flyball, and herding, but are not known for doing as well in the very formal competition obedience ring.

			<h4> Siberian Husky</h4>
			The Siberian Husky is a beautiful dog breed with a thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and markings. Their blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of this breed, which originated in Siberia. It is easy to see why many are drawn to the Siberian’s wolf-like looks, but be aware that this athletic, intelligent dog can be independent and challenging for first-time dog owners. Huskies also put the “H” in Houdini and need a fenced yard that is sunk in the ground to prevent escapes.

			<h4>Shiba Inu</h4>
			The Shiba Inu dog breed was originally bred to flush birds and small game, and was occasionally used to hunt wild boar. He is one of Japan’s six native breeds: Akita (large), Kishu, Hokkaido, Kai, Shikoku (medium), and Shiba (small). He is known for his spirited personality, small upright ears, and cat-like agility. Today he serves primarily as a companion dog in Japan and the United States.

			<h4>Shetland Sheepdog</h4>
			The French Bulldog has enjoyed a long history as a companion dog. Created in England to be a miniature Bulldog, he accompanied English lacemakers to France, where he acquired his Frenchie moniker. Besides being a companion, he once served as an excellent ratter, but today his job focuses on being a fabulous family friend and show dog. He’s a rare dog breed, so expect to put in some time on a waiting list before you’re able to bring one home.

			<h4>Samoyed</h4>
			Originally bred to hunt, haul sledges, and herd reindeer, the Samoyed dog breed proved a valuable companion for northwestern Siberia’s Samoyede people. Among the breed’s duties: pack hiking, tracking, and warming their owners by sleeping on top of them at night. A working breed, the Samoyed can be strong-willed at times, but above all they remain friendly, gentle, and devoted family dogs.
